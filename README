MALLOC PROJECT
--------------
A basic  malloc implemented using best fit and first fit algorithm. 

DEPENDENCIE: 
		sys/man.h library
		malloc.h

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION: 

NAME
		malloc calloc realloc -- allocate memory by block 
		free -- freed memory block 
LIBRARY 
		malloc.h
SYNOPSIS
		void *
		------ malloc(void *ptr); 
		------ realloc(void *ptr, size_t size); 
		------ calloc(size_t, size_t);

		void
		------ free(void *ptr); 

DESCRIPTION:
		Malloc function use best fit combine with first fit algorithm depending on
		the asking size.
		Malloc takes one argument a size. This size is align on 4 bytes if it's not.

		Calloc take two sizes the first is the type size and the second the number of
		elment of this size you want to allocate. Calloc set the memory block at 0; 

		realloc this function tries to change the size of the old memory block
		pointed by ptr. size is the new reallocated block size that we want. 
		If you pass a NULL value to realloc and a size, if this size is zero realloc
		allocates a 8 memory block else if a greater size is given  a pointer on
		an align block of the asking size is return.   

		free take a pointer in 
		
RETURN VALUE 
		If successful, malloc, calloc, realloc return a pointer to allocated momery
		block. In other case a NULL pointer. 

NOTE
		Malloc function doesn't free NULL pointer and if a zero size is given malloc
		return a 8 size block;
